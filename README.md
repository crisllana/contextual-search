# Contextual-search

Develop proficiency in mapping datafeeds with hierarchy or inter-related documents.

## Context
Traditional search engines often rely on keywords to retrieve information, but a contextualized search engine aims to understand the user's intent more comprehensively by considering various contextual cues. By doing so, it seeks to deliver more accurate and personalized results.

In this case, we aim to understand the datafeed and the relationship among entries.

## Mission
Without using vectorized search, this team will develop a PoC of a contextualized search experience built following our trust principles. This means the context should be based on our understanding of the datafeed and the users' job to be done.

## Vision
We will build a joyful experience where a user can find what they query in an index with inter-related documents. Results are organised in a way that allows the user to understand the queryâ€™s results at first glance under their ontologies and/or taxonomies and/or categories.
